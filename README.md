# What landscapes are genetic algorithms good at?

A genetic algorithm is a state space search strategy. It recombines a population of states to produce more optimal populations of states, much like how evolution by natural selection recombines a population of individuals to produce more optimal populations of individuals.

With a well-chosen fitness function, computer scientists hope to use genetic algorithms to efficiently find optimal states. I will analyze what cases genetic algorithms are a good choice for.
